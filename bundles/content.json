The mission: make some yummy chocolate chip cookies. Something about [making chocolate chip cookies](/cookies/) always strikes the right notes with me. When I bake my soul is at ease. Me and the cookies are one. I am not sure what it is; part science, part chocolate, lots of sugar, and of course, smiles. People love cookies and I love making people smile.\n\nAfter I had lots of cookies, I needed someone to eat them. Deciding to give them to cyclists heading home from work was the easy part. The real inspiration struck me while reading about the ongoing conflict in Ladd's Circle. And so my first Experiment in Kindness was born. You can see [the lab notes here](https://github.com/joehand/smilingjoe/blob/gh-pages/experiments/_posts/2011-06-30-freecookies.markdown).\n\nThe response of the complete strangers receiving cookies amazed me. I cannot remember a better bike ride than the one returning home after that experience. It did not take long for me to launch [smilingjoe.com](http://smilingjoe.com) and make it a goal to keep my experiments going. The experiment was also featured [on the local bike blog](https://bikeportland.org/2011/07/01/solution-for-ladd-circle-stop-sign-issue-cookies-55819), BikePortland.\n\nKindness begets kindness. We can each make the world a better place with kindnesses small or large. Even if my experiments fail or stop completely, I know that for that one day, in those 30 minutes, I put smiles on 100 faces and that is enough.\n\n> The day always looks brighter from behind a smile.","name":"2013-06-experiements-in-kindness","path":"/content/blog/2013-06-experiements-in-kindness","url":"/blog/2013-06-experiements-in-kindness","files":{},"pages":{}},"/blog/2013-escape-south-africa":{"title":"Escape from South Africa","date":"2013-06-30","visible":true,"view":"entry","text":"### How to travel with your sister’s passport, and the flu\n\nSweat dripping and the hum of the fluorescents made for a soothing combination of sounds, but I was focusing on something else. Two immigration officers were in the next room discussing my passport, or perhaps it was my sister’s? I listened, but I could not understand.\n\nI sat in a dank room, walls grim, worn carpet, and cheap chairs. Federal offices all over the world must order from the same catalog. Another gentlemen from an undisclosed country waited with me. I sat wiping sweat off my brow, he paced. Was this a nightmare? Fevered hallucinations? No, this was my attempted escape from the Johannesburg airport.\n\nYes, I had flu but was I really that compromised? Scenarios ran through my head. It was useless. My exit out of South Africa sat in the hands of the portly officer.\n\n---\n\nFourteen days prior I blissfully boarded my plane from Frankfurt to Johannesburg. I was heading to Africa for the first time. My mind full of anticipation, wonder, and excitement.\n\nTen hours later I am preparing for my way through immigration, someone will scan my passport.\n\nYou see, my passport has two odd features I discovered right before my trip. First, my picture is from when I was fifteen. I have long hair. Oh, and I could easily be mistaken for a girl. Look closely and you may recognize me. But there’s something else…\n\n**The gender on my passport says female.**\n\n![Notice the “F” under Sex](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/3752/0*XwOJlQ-ErrMahIvQ.jpeg)\n*Notice the “F” under Sex*\n\n## Sneaking into South Africa\n\nThe line for entering South Africa is long and painful. After two ten hour sleepless flights I am exhausted. Rather than try to explain my gender situation I decide to feign ignorance. Two passport checks in Germany were no problem.\n\nI hand the immigration officer my passport and I wait, nervously. First she questions the picture. I try to explain, I’ve changed, I was young then, fifteen. She looks at gender inquisitively. She asks, and what is your gender?\n\nI’m male, of course. Unfortunately, my passport does not say male. The officer asks, “Why do you have your sister’s passport?” I act confused. She kindly points out the error and I am aghast.\n\nI’ve never been good at acting. She directs me to sit in the corner, dunce cap on while waiting for the supervisor, clocks tick.\n\nMy passport makes rounds. The supervisor asks fellow officers if the person in the picture is male or female. They ask me why I have my sisters passport. My confidence is shaky. I am not sure if I will ever touch the soil of South africa.\n\nI present my drivers license, I feel a hint of encouragement. I explain that I am here for work and am presenting the next day. After more discussion and a scolding for having a ten year old passport that incorrectly identifies me as a girl, they reluctantly let me in, phew.\n\n---\n\n## Judgement Day\n\nMy journey home is filled with anxiety. I worry again about my passport, whether I will be able to get home. I know they have stricter immigration checks than most other countries. I never imagined what was ahead for me.\n\nI leave Cape Town with a sore throat, a runny nose, and a slight fever. I arrive in Johannesburg with a terrible fever and stomach ache, barely able to utter a word. With a few hours before my connection I must find medicine.\n\nLuckily the first store after getting off the plane was a full-fledged pharmacy. After trying to navigate the mostly-Afrikaans labeled medicine I get in line for the pharmacist. The gentleman in front of me explains his daughters symptoms, they are exactly what I am feeling. I buy the same medicine and walk out with relief.\n\nAfter visiting the restroom and taking my medicine I start making my way to my gate. I begin sweating as I schlepp my bags through the airport. As I get closer and closer I realized I have to go through security again.\n\nI’m confident, South African airport security seems relaxed. I prepare my bags, chug my water, and get in line. As I get closer I see another line after security, passport control.\n\nI hoped the passport control was casual, similar to Germany. They scrutinize your passport getting into a country, I never imagined it would be hard to get out of a country.\n\nAs I joined the queue I realized this could be the beginning of my nightmare. And it came earlier than expected. The line crawls. And it wasn’t for a lack of people checking passports.\n\nWhile waiting in line I survey the immigration officers. I tried to find a reasonable one. I rule out one, he looks terrifying.\n\nI drew him, of course! I presented my passport, damp with perspiration. His eyes set on the passport then he looks up at me. And again. And again. UP, down, up , down.Then comes the question I never expected.\n\n> ### “This is not your passport. Where is your passport?”\n\nI’m dead silent. I nervously point out that my picture is old and I am a male even though it says female. I try to explain that it is mine. He quickly calls someone else over and says something I don’t understand. I am pulled aside and he tells me to go with him. Oh no.\n\nWeighted with luggage and sweat I struggle to keep up with my leader. We wander through the terminal, seemingly endless, before exiting through a side door. After an enduring set of stairs, locked doors with fingerprint security, and several long poorly lit hallways we end up in the requisite federal waiting room. My passport and ticket are ripped from my hands.\n\nI’m drenched. The passport draws a furious discussion between officers as they study the picture. One officer pokes her head in to get a closer look. The other sketchy-passport refugee joins me and begins pacing. Finally, I am summed to the supervisors office.\n\nI am grilled on the details of my passport: why did you not correct your passport, what are you doing in South Africa, where are you going? I try to explain my situation. I present my license and offer my full wallet for evidence. He stays quiet but keeps shaking his head.\n\nHe’s holding my ticket. I have ten minutes until boarding closes. After some hesitation he calls in his colleague to escort me back to the original passport control. I breath a silent sigh of relief, hoping this means freedom.\n\nOnce we start moving the officer asks me which line I came from. We are in the caverns of this airport. So many stairs, and hallways, passing doors, and I have a terrible fever. I am lost. I declare my utter state of delirium.\n\nWe are back in the main terminal. He asks again “Don’t you remember what line you were in?” Finally, I get my bearings and we make our way back.\n\nAs we approach the officer who originally sent me away, my nerves return. I go through the same process showing him my license, explaining my situation, and perspiring. It’s clear he does not want to let me through but knows his supervisor approved it. He writes down all of my information, looks at my ticket and tells me to run, fast!\n\nI give a quick thanks and start running. Running away. Running toward freedom, at least temporary freedom. All I want to do is sit, have some water, and sleep.\n\nI’m running for what seems like miles. I break and realize I am departing from the furthest gate. I keep running and running, catching my breath, resting on the electric sidewalk , and then my last sprint to the end.\n\nI see the gate, the door is still open. I made it. Coughing and winded but with a lighter heart I hand my boarding ticket and passport to the gate attendant. And then the question comes.\n\n> “Are you sure this is you?”\n\nTrying to stay composed I tell her I have changed a lot in the last ten year. She laughs and tells me I have really grown into a man and motions me onto the plane. I made it. I made it. I made it.\n\n---\n\n## Home Sweet Home\n\nDuring the plane ride I pass through three mental states: sleep, feverous delusion, and distress about getting through Germany and into the US.\n\nI find luck in Germany by missing any of the passport control stations. I enjoy my connection there like no other flight connection I have ever had. I feel like the king of the world, free to move about Terminal 1-Z doing whatever I please.\n\n![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/6528/0*yz0zMb9xzx6bQlI4.jpeg)\n\nMy tranquil state carries over for most of the flight to the US. I get to fly one of the double-decker Airbus planes for the first time. I enjoy my last moments of freedom. We are handed the US customs forms and the hammer of reality drops.\n\nOnce again, in the passport line and my mind is racing. What do I say? How do I tell them it is really me? I decide to be my true self and explain my situation honestly.\n\nI approach the US immigration officer, no expectations. I hand him my passport, explaining my situation. There is an error on my passport. I found out about it right before my trip, I did not have time to change it. The picture is from many years ago. I had long hair, and yes, And don’t worry, I submitted the application for an error correction today. I have a drivers license if that helps. I am not sure what to do, I barely got out of South Africa.\n\nHe stays silent. He looks at me, looks at my passport, scans the passport, and examines my drivers license. And finally he speaks.\n\n> ### “Are you sure you didn’t get a gender change operation on the plane?”\n\nDeep, uncontrollable laughter releases days worth of tension, I tell him no, I have always been a male. Contrary to all expectations he explains how I can get my passport fixed and that I can probably get a new longer expiration time out of it for free. Then he stamps my customs document and sends me on my way. The relief is palatable.\n\nThe rest of the journey home has its hiccups but I know I can get there. It may be painful, full of delays, bloody noses, and dehydration, but I can make it without worrying about my passport.\n\n---\n\nAnd don’t worry, I submitted the application for an error correction today. No longer will I be flying as my sister. Or a female fifteen year-old male. Or anyone but myself. Because in the end being true to who I am is the best way out of a very sticky situation.","name":"2013-escape-south-africa","path":"/content/blog/2013-escape-south-africa","url":"/blog/2013-escape-south-africa","files":{},"pages":{}},"/blog/2014-03-reed-college":{"title":"The Reed College Experience","date":"2014-05-01","visible":true,"view":"entry","text":"The Reed College experience is often hard to capture.

[In this post](http://www.mrmoneymustache.com/2012/01/13/the-shockingly-simple-math-behind-early-retirement/) Mr. Money Mustache presents an amazingly simple and shockingly effective way to look at retirement; the amount of time until you can retire is simple a function of your savings rate. What doesn't matter? Your income, your spending, your age, or anything else.\n\nNot only is the equation simple, the idea behind it is very powerful. Looking at the table he presents, you can see that by increasing your savings from 10% to 15% you can chop 8 years off your time until retirement. Wow!\n\nThe reason this works? In order to increase your savings rate, you probably have to decrease your spending. This means that you will be able to live off less for the rest of your life. And your money saved will be compounded over time. So, there are some strict assumptions in there. But the idea behind everything is very intriguing, and I suggest you at least [take a look](http://www.mrmoneymustache.com/2012/01/13/the-shockingly-simple-math-behind-early-retirement/).\n\nI just discovered the Mr. Money Mustache site but already it has become an invaluable resource on financial advice for me. It bucks much of the conventional wisdom and focuses on spending less through decreased consumption, an idea that is close to my heart.

Or Africa at all for that matter. My task was to train a mothers’ group from the Khayelitsha township in Cape Town how to use the prototype data collection tool we were designing for Shack/Slum Dwellers International. I had no business doing this. As a white, American, privileged male with no international experience, I was about as far as you could get from my users living in informal settlements of developing countries worldwide.\n\nIt was a spectacular flop. The first day was training. The second day we were supposed to use these new tools in the field during a community-driven settlement profile. The second day came and the only person using the new tool was me — I gave up half way through. We resorted to pen and paper.\n\nWhen we got back to the US, we didn’t go back to the drawing board. We threw it in the trash. We were supposed to make a tool that could be used in over 30 countries in the Global South in community-driven data collection activities. Different languages. Different technological capacities. Different types of data collection. Different understandings of the word *household*. We couldn’t even get one community group to understand the prototype.\n\n---\n\nCertain technologies and platforms *thrive* on being unfriendly to new users. This may sound strange, but do you remember the first time you used Twitter? Snapchat? Have you ever tried to teach someone your own age how to use Twitter or Snapchat? Have you tried to explain to a parent how they work? What about a grandparent?\n\nTwitter makes absolutely no sense until you use it. Snapchat is successful precisely because it [confuses olds](http://www.bloomberg.com/features/2016-how-snapchat-built-a-business/). These platforms aren’t hard to use once you are in but they make it hard to get in.\n\nUsers like these platforms because there is a price to entry. Once you learn how to use them, you become a part of the club. It’s an initiation ritual. Don’t want to spend the time understanding what a follower is and what a retweet means? Sorry, you don’t belong.\n\nIn these platforms, there is a high amount of friction for new users. Either you overcome this and are rewarded, or you remain an outsider.\n\n---\n\nMost companies take the opposite approach. They want everyone in: Facebook, Apple, Slack (current pinnacle of user friendly). These companies try to get as many people using their tools as possible with minimal resistance.\n\nEven though they make it easy, they still force you to think in a certain way. Try riding a bike in a way it wasn’t designed for. Use your doorknob like it belongs to a sliding door. Use an Apple like it was an Android. Eat an android like it was an apple.\n\nForcing people to think and act in certain ways is the Achilles’ heel of technology (technology in the broadest sense; try using a fiery stick like its a regular stick). Technology cannot be developed without assumptions.\n\nAll tools we create have their own structure and terms of use. New users must learn these peculiarities. This can be an asset (Snapchat, Twitter) or something to minimize. You have to face this hurdle or ignore it at your peril (and without compassion for your users).\n\n---\n\nIn the end, we succeeded in creating a new data collection pipeline for Slum/Shack Dwellers International with lots of awesome work from communities worldwide, [Ona](http://ona.io/), and [Enketo](https://enketo.org/), and partners at SDI.\n\nOver 7,000 communities worldwide have collected and updated their profile data in a year, a feat that previously took over five years. In Accra, Ghana the community and support partners have data on over 4,000 services: whether the service is working, the quality of the service, and who owns and manages the service (perhaps better data than the city government has):\n\n![Informal Settlement Services in Accra (Interface: [Ona.io](https://ona.io), Data: SDI & People’s Dialogue on Human Settlements, Ghana)](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2314/1*UxzcdBDVA3e14TvnNPORGw.png)\n\n*Informal Settlement Services in Accra (Interface: [Ona.io](https://ona.io), Data: SDI & People’s Dialogue on Human Settlements, Ghana)*\n\n---\n\n## Create a user friendly product by admitting your product isn’t user friendly\n\n1. Minimize new user friction.\n2. Admit that users need to learn new ideas. Users will be uncomfortable at first, that’s okay.\n3. Introduce new concepts, terms, and UI elements slowly. Let users test one function at a time. Guide them through the process but do not force them to move forward. Make sure users can enter or move forward at their own pace.\n4. Allow users to enter at any level of complexity. Give users small and concrete awards for each new hurdle they cross.\n\n---\n\n[Read the details of how we addressed these with SDI](blog/2016-03-24-data-platform/).\n\nEach technology and platform will be different. For another example, look at the writing experience here on Medium.\n\n1. Minimal friction. “Write here” box on the homepage. Once click and users get a text box, a familiar thing.\n2. Admit users will be uncomfortable. Don’t make them “start a new draft.” That sounds like a commitment. Let them write first, explore functionality later.\n3. Add concepts slowly. Want see more features? Go full screen and show formatting tips on the bottom *but don’t force a user through them.*\n4. Instant rewards. Write something and publish. It takes two clicks and some writing to publish content. Awesome.\n\nMedium starts with the most basic functionality (writing) and allows the user to expand their knowledge as they get comfortable.\n\nYour product will not be user friendly. Admit it to yourself. Help your users through the friction. Have compassion for them. Introduce ideas slowly.\n\nEach user needs an entry point. Too simple and they will overlook the tool as too basic. Too complex and they will get frustrated and leave. **Identify the steps of complexity of your technology and make it straightforward to enter at any point on the ladder.**\n\nFinally, make sure they get rewards for their learning & patience.\n\nAnd if you want to build the next Snapchat? Do the opposite of everything above.","name":"2016-03-23-user-friendly","path":"/content/blog/2016-03-23-user-friendly","url":"/blog/2016-03-23-user-friendly","files":{},"pages":{}},"/blog/2016-03-24-data-platform":{"title":"How to Build an International Data Platform","date":"2016-03-24","visible":true,"text":"Creating a user friendly experience is not easy. Especially when you are not the user and don’t know much about the end user.\n\n**If you didn’t see the introduction post**, [check it out here](/blog/2016-03-23-user-friendly/). Here is the short version:\n\nIn order to create a user friendly product, you should:\n\n1. Minimize new user friction.\n2. Admit that users need to learn new ideas to use your product.\n3. Introduce new concepts, terms, and UI elements slowly.\n4. Give users small and concrete awards for each new hurdle they cross.\n5. (In our case) Have awesome and patient users.\n\nWe had our own unique challenges in addressing each of these. But in the end, it was mostly about compassion for our users.\n\n---\n\n### Minimize New User Friction\n\nWe quickly scrapped the mobile-first approach we had prototyped. Everyone is familiar with pen and paper. They won’t get stolen or have dead batteries. They won’t need internet connections to upload data. We started there.\n\n(We still made mobile and tablets an option. Certain users may have more friction with paper than mobile. Paper creates other frictions later.)\n\nWhen users moved to digital, we made it seamless by making the digital form look **exactly** the same as the paper form (huge props here to Martijn van de Rijdt at [Enketo](https://enketo.org/)), including any language or local wording differences.\n\nBy the end, we had communities members that had never touched a computer before collecting and entering data.\n\n### Admit Users Will Be Uncomfortable\n\nWe had to be upfront with our users. People like learning and trying new things, but not to the point of frustration. In our training we had to tell the community this would be hard. They were learning lots of new things. We took breaks. We did fun things on breaks. Most importantly, we always presented something at the end showing the result of their hard work.\n\n### Introduce New Concepts Slowly\n\nGoing from zero technical knowledge to collecting and entering geographic data was a big hurdle. We did not acknowledge this at the first prototype training. Once we failed one time, we had to think about how we could separate these new ideas.\n\nWe started with the basic data collection on paper. No map concepts. No digital devices. Collecting and entering population numbers, community problems, things people lived with in their daily life: numbers and text.\n\nOnce the communities understood what “data” meant, then we moved them to the computer. They were able to enter the data and see how it feels to move from paper to computer. After a form was completely entered, they could print the digital version of their completed form. It looked the exact same as the pen copy but printed ink, more permanent. This also gave reassurance that what had been written on paper was also recorded digitally.\n\nAfter users were comfortable with digital forms we could start introducing geographic concepts by starting with a satellite map of a familiar place, their neighborhood. Whenever there we new concepts we needed to anchor with familiar topics (GIS concepts anchored in the map of their neighborhood). New topics, familiar concepts. Don’t do both at once.\n\nWe had lots of other types of users too. We had NGO GIS professionals. They could dive right into the map tool, a familiar concept, and start exploring similar filtering and mapping tools. We had heavy Excel users. They could create instant reports with common Excel functions from a live database.\n\nEach user needs an entry point. Too simple and they will overlook the tool as too basic. Too complex and they will get frustrated and leave. **Identify the steps of complexity of your technology and make it straightforward to enter at any point on the ladder.**\n\nWe added layer upon layer without requiring everything to be done to see results. Users could see results right away, in whatever domain they were comfortable.\n\n### Give Users Rewards for New Ideas Learned\n\nEvery time a user learns a new concept they should be rewarded. Cement that concept in their mind.

The comprehensive plan, and Policy 2.11 unamended, is the ideal place to encourage innovative, open, and transparent partnerships between the City and its communities, which without Open Data will not be possible.\n\nI’ve worked in cities worldwide on Open Data. I’ve helped communities in informal settlements to collect land use data throughout the Global South. This data fosters a culture of transparency and accountability around planning and development. Open Data transforms communities. Through Open Data we increase the accountability of city governments and ultimately improve lives. Unfortunately, better public service data currently exists for slums of Lagos, Nigeria than Portland, Oregon.\n\nThroughout the comprehensive plan, many goals and policies overlap Open Data: intergovernmental coordination (Policy 1.15), community involvement as partnership (Goal 2.A), **transparency and accountability** (Goal 2.D), **strong civic infrastructure** (Goal 2.G), **two-way channels of communication** (Policy 2.8), community participation in data collection (Policy 2.10), **verifying data** (Policy 2.25), **tools for effective participation **(Policy 2.39), small business development (Policy 6.9), **business innovation** (Policy 6.10), sharing economy (Policy 6.11), public service coordination (Policy 8.8), **internal coordination** (Policy 8.9), coordination (Policy 8.46), Vision Zero (Goal 9.A, as amended), **performance measures** (Policy 9.48), and innumerable others. People may not think of these policies and goals as Open Data. But Open Data will help us accomplish them.\n\n**Take Goal 2.D, for example, Transparency and Accountability**. The City makes many land use decisions using data (maps, testimonials, surveys, etc.). In drafting the comprehensive plan, we have seen how data is fundamental to the process. Each of the testimonials, amendments, and zoning changes — these are all data. To make the City transparent and accountable in this process, this data must be public and usable. **Without opening data around land use decisions, the City cannot be transparent. Without sharing data in a format usable by software, communities cannot hold the City accountable.**\n\n### Portland Open Data Part 1\n\nThe first implementation of Open Data for Portland was [CivicApps.org](http://www.civicapps.org/). CivicApps was an innovative way to share public data. Students, technologists, and activists visited CivicApps.org to use Portland data. Users commented from North Carolina, Massachusetts, and even France.\n\nUnfortunately, we can also look at CivicApps to see what Open Data is not. The data is stale. It was last updated since 2014. Most of the communication was one-way, the City rarely responded to comments. If users found errors, there was no way to correct them.\n\nOpen Data will help the City be transparent and accountable. It will encourage tools for effective participation. Open Data can create two-way channels of communication and improve internal coordination. To do these, we need to understand Open Data as a process, not a one-time and one-way publication of data.\n\n### Vision Zero and Open Data\n\nWe can look at Vision Zero to help understand what Open Data means. At first, the idea of needing a Vision Zero policy may seem frivolous. *Of course, *you may say*, the City does not design roads, set transportation policy, or set enforcement priorities with the goal of **increasing** traffic fatalities. *But then, why do we need Vision Zero?\n\nWe need Vision Zero to articulate our priorities within transportation policies and practices. A transportation engineer does not design a street to kill people, but it happens. Vision Zero prompts an engineer to think “how may this design result in a fatality?”, where she otherwise may not. Vision Zero requires “a comprehensive approach”, “a strategic planning effort”, and “collaboration from a wide range of partners”. Vision Zero is a process. It cannot be successful unless every person within our transportation system absorbs the mentality.\n\nThe amended Open Data policy, amendment P11, reads:\n\n> “**Where appropriate**, encourage publication, accessibility and wide-spread sharing of data collected and generated by the City.”\n\nCan you imagine if our Vision Zero goal was similarly worded?\n\n> “**Where appropriate**, encourage planners and engineers to design roads that minimize fatalities on roads maintained by the City.”\n\nWe could not achieve Vision Zero by trying to reduce fatalities ***where appropriate. ***We’ve experienced this over the last several decades and seen how it has failed our community. It is misguided to expect the same for Open Data. Open Data is not a one-time initiative. It is an ethos the City must adopt, one of transparency, openness, and accountability.\n\nThough it may seem foolish to compare Open Data to Vision Zero, Open Data can improve and even save lives. Digital tools will be as important as physical infrastructure in 2035, when this comprehensive plan expires. We will not succeed by setting our targets low, publishing data only ***where appropriate.***\n\nThere are already cities partnering with technology companies using Open Data to accomplish Vision Zero, Portland could be next.\n\n### Transparency and Accountability\n\nTwo stated goals of the comprehensive plan, transparency and accountability, keep appearing. These two ideas encompass Open Data.\n\nTransparency is publishing all information used in land use and planning decisions. This includes source data, maps, databases, and community feedback or public commentary. The City is already accomplishing a lot around transparency. We’ve experienced this transparency during the comprehensive plan update. But Open Data is not just publishing data, that is only half of it. Open Data is a conversation, a partnership.\n\nAccountability is the harder part of Open Data. There are two sides to accountability in Open Data. Most importantly, the city must release data in a way the community can use it, analogous to how the City used it. Citizens must be able to use similar tools as the City to hold them accountable. This requires data released in a timely, machine-readable, and documented manner.\n\nImagine I send the IRS my income data in a language of my own invention. This would prevent them from calculating my taxes. How could I expect them to hold me accountable for my taxes? I wouldn’t (and I could expect an audit later). If the City shares data in proprietary or non-machine readable formats, the citizens are hamstrung in holding the City accountable.\n\nSecondly, the City must have mechanisms to respond to citizen feedback from that data. This feedback could include errors in the data, a contention with data analysis results, or general comments. Open Data is a two-way street where the City provides transparent information and citizens provide accountability.\n\nOpen Data must be a ubiquitous goal, not something done after-the-fact, when appropriate, and as a one-way distribution.\n\n### Portland Open Data Part 2\n\nMayor and commissioners, we all strive for a transparent and accountable City. We want to foster increased community participation, better civic infrastructure, and improved internal coordination. We need to save lives and achieve Vision Zero. None of this can happen without Open Data.\n\nCitizens, non-profits, small businesses, and advocates need access to public data. The City uses data to make land use and planning decisions and communities should be able to do the same. We want to use this data to create tools for community participation, to understand traffic fatalities, and to hold government officials accountable. Open Data can help communities improve equity, deepen our understanding of underrepresented groups, and learn new ways to love Portland.\n\nPlease retain Policy 2.11, the Open Data policy, as originally drafted.\n\nSincerely,\n\nJoe Hand","name":"2016-04-27-pdx-open-data","path":"/content/blog/2016-04-27-pdx-open-data","url":"/blog/2016-04-27-pdx-open-data","files":{},"pages":{}},"/blog/2017-08-25-jhand-space":{"title":"A new space for writing & experiments","date":"2017-09-14","visible":true,"view":"entry","text":"Welcome to jhand.space!

They published an extensive report on [the decentralized web](http://dci.mit.edu/decentralizedweb) covering existing technologies, their benefits and shortcomings.\n\nAs someone working on decentralized technology it's been a great resource. Unfortunately Beaker Browser, a peer-to-peer web browser powered by Dat, is not included in the research (the research was funded by the Knight Foundation, one of the main funders for Dat). Dat has not marketed around the decentralized web capabilities, something we are changing soon. And part of me is a bit happy Dat is not be lumped in with the technologies studied. We are the only nonprofit developing decentralized web tools and we hope to do things differently. Less marketing, less hype, just trying to make public infrastructure for a better future.\n\nRecently, they published an [opinion piece in Wired](https://www.wired.com/story/decentralized-social-networks-sound-great-too-bad-theyll-never-work/) identifying all the reasons decentralized social networks will never work. There are some good reasons in there, but the main thing that struck me was that all the concerns are *human-driven*, not *technological* shortcomings.\n\nThe arguments against decentralized platforms fall under these issues:\n\n1. \"these tools will face challenges acquiring users and gaining the attention of developers\" - because of network effects and bad user interfaces.\n2. \"These platforms also pose new security threats\" - because of lack of real-world identities and confusing public key cryptography\n3. \"Designing robust reward mechanisms to curate content that keeps people informed rather than entertained remains a problem.\" - and these curation tools are expensive.\n4. \"platforms benefit from economies of scale\" (both technological and social) - storage/bandwidth are cheaper at scale and social network effects make platforms more useful.\n\nAll of these issues are either solved technological problems, or human/social issues. To say that decentralized social networks will never work is to admit the technical problems will overshadow the human problems.\n\n> The reality is that most people do not want to run their own web servers or social network nodes. They want to engage with the web through friendlier platforms, and these platforms will be constrained by the same forces that drive consolidation today.\n\nThis is the root of the issue. This assumes that running servers or nodes is a prerequisite to decentralized social networks (it is not). This assumes that our public spaces and private spaces need to all exist in the same platform - and that the platform *must* be consolidated, thus centralized. The problem is that we think of Facebook, Twitter as the *platform*. And to succeed as such a platform, it must be a monopoly, which is the case. But, isn't it the web that is the platform?\n\n> A better strategy would be to pursue policies that strengthen the environment for decentralized platforms, including data portability, interoperability, and alternatives to advertising-based funding models.\n>\n> Decentralized web advocates have good intentions, but there’s no silver-bullet technical solution for the challenges that lie ahead.\n\n...\n\n> The platforms that host and inform our networked public sphere are unelected, unaccountable, and often impossible to audit or oversee.\n\nThese arguments all make the assumption that online public spaces must be privately owned and funded. This limits revenue sources to a few basic sources: ads, selling user data, or subscriptions. This assumption is correct in our current political environment but discounting other possibilities is why this restriction could fail in the future.\n\n> ... highlights the ever-expanding ways in which we now rely on large private platforms to facilitate our online activities.\n\nThe core issue here is that we are relying on private enterprises to run our public online spaces. Nowhere is it mentioned that maybe, perhaps, some of these private platforms need to be public spaces. Real life and online life are now inseparable. Why do we keep forcing our public lives to be managed by private companies? Just as starting public libraries would not be viable in the current political atmosphere, starting public online spaces is not even considered.\n\nThere are still a lot of questions about what a public online space means. But to fully disregarding that possibility continues to lead us to a path of relying on private companies to live life online.","name":"2017-09-14-decentralized-social","path":"/content/blog/2017-09-14-decentralized-social","url":"/blog/2017-09-14-decentralized-social","files":{},"pages":{}},"/blog/2017-09-15-business-thinking":{"title":"Resources for Thoughtful Technology Businesses","visible":true,"date":"2017-09-15","view":"entry","text":"In the last few months I've been thinking and reading a lot about starting and funding thoughtful technology businesses.

What started as a research project has become the source of tbhe world's largest fourtunes. It is only expected that the capitalist mindset would be mirrored in software design.\n\nFor those who skipped economics 101, rightly so, there is a large gap between economic models and the real world. Most economic models assume humans have perfect information and make decisions purely in economic terms. As economic models have moved to reflect the real world, the real world has also shifted towards economic models. To achieve a perfectly capitalism world we need less trust and human-driven differenetiation (things like location).\n\nBitcoin and blockchain are the most visisble instance of this shift. To achieve a pefect capitalist market (a libertarian dream) you need perfect information and no friction in transactions. And by creating trustless global markets we move a step in that direction.\n\nBlockchain technology takes humans out of the picture *by design*. There is idea of wet code versus dry code in the blockchain world. Wet code is humans. Is is messy and not perfect. Dry code is the opposite. Without trust, there is no reason to differentiate between equal competitors or build relationships. If I am trying to buy file storage, I want the cheapest price - there is no other constraint because all other factors have been guarenteed by the software (availablility, reliability, etc.). This makes social constructs, such as groups, communities, or trust useless. And that is the purpose, those are part of wet code.\n\n(warning: rant about capitalism ahead)\n\nTo achieve this level of capitalist prefection the market must be completely trustless. Bitcoin, for example, is an extension of pure capitalism. In capitalism, businesses relentlessly pursue increasing returns to scale. To lower production prices business seek the lowest paid labor, reduce expenses on non-essential things like healthcare, and advocate for less regulation and lower taxes.\n\nIn seeking capital accumulation, markets generally leverage increaing amounts of resource consumption. These resources could be human, as we saw in slavery-driven America, or natural resources.\n\nTrustless networks furthur enable this.\n\nwe need a system that still enables group collaboration. If everyone in a group trusts each other, there is no reason to get technologically more complex. Keep it human.\n\nwe need \"human sized technology\".\n\nfacebook, google, are also non human. network effect leads towards non-human solutions in order to monetize effectively. human requires it can work as well in small groups as large networks, without increasing returns to scale.\n\n**also similar to zebra startup idea** reference that at beginning\n\nhttps://medium.com/@sexandstartups/zebras-lets-get-in-formation-fdcbc72fec4a\nhttps://medium.com/@sexandstartups/zebrasfix-c467e55f9d96\n\nhttps://nytimes.com/2017/09/15/business/cryptocurrency-bubble-doge.html\nhttps://medium.com/humane-tech/toward-humane-tech-23a20405681a\nhttps://medium.com/humane-tech","name":"2017-09-15-human-tech","path":"/content/blog/2017-09-15-human-tech","url":"/blog/2017-09-15-human-tech","files":{},"pages":{}},"/blog/open-source-licensing":{"title":"Learning About Open Source Licenses (+ License Zero)","date":"2018-07-05","view":"entry","text":"Resources:\n\n* https://nadiaeghbal.com/oss/\n* https://www.fordfoundation.org/library/reports-and-studies/roads-and-bridges-the-unseen-labor-behind-our-digital-infrastructure/\n* https://guide.licensezero.com\n* https://www.npmjs.com/package/licensee","name":"open-source-licensing","path":"/content/blog/open-source-licensing","url":"/blog/open-source-licensing","files":{},"pages":{}},"/books":{"title":"Books","visible":true,"view":"page","text":"Currently Reading:\n\n* [The Attention Merchants: The Epic Scramble to Get Inside Our Heads](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/32674176-the-attention-merchants) by Tim Wu\n* The Hero with a Thousand Faces\n\n## 2018\n\nRead in 2018 ([goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3653103-joe)):\n\n* Taking the Leap: Freeing Ourselves from Old Habits and Fears, by Pema Chödrön\n* The Stone Sky (The Broken Earth, #3), by N.K.

Chocolate chip cookies are the best cookies. So if we can make the best chocolate chip cookies, then we can make the best cookies.\n\nMaking cookies is mostly a science. Once you get the scientific part down, a little bit of practice makes perfect. These cookies are so good they were [tested experimentally](https://bikeportland.org/2011/07/01/solution-for-ladd-circle-stop-sign-issue-cookies-55819) as a replacement for stop signs.\n\nSo, how do you make the best cookies in the world? Follow these instructions, practice, get to know your oven, and then check out the advanced tips at the bottom.\n\n![Cookie Dough](cookie_dough.jpg \"Dough Prepared for Oven (Credit:Joe Hand)\")\n\n*Definitely do not bake your cookies this close together*\n\n### Chocolate Chip Cookies\n\nFollow the directions, make yummy cookies, and share them with your friends.\n\n#### Ingredients (double or triple as necessary):\n\n * 2 Cups Flour\n * 1/2 tsp Sea Salt\n * 1/2 tsp Baking Soda\n * 1 c Brown Sugar\n * 1/2 c White Sugar\n * 3/4 c Butter\n * 1 egg\n * 1 egg yolk\n * 1 tbsp vanilla\n\n##### Tools\n\n* Two large mixing bowls\n* Cup + spoon measuring devices\n* Oven\n* Baking Sheet\n* Silicon Baking Mat (optional)\n* Kitchen Scale (optional)\n\n#### Directions\n\n1. Start by getting all of your ingredients out in one place. That way you will not forget anything. Put things away after each step and make cleaning so much easier!\n2. Mix dry stuff in bowl, set aside.\n * 2 Cups Flour\n * 1/2 tsp Sea Salt\n * 1/2 tsp Baking Soda\n3. Mix sugars and butter in new bowl. Melted butter is easier but changes how dough bakes (__see advanced tips__). Make sure it all gets mixed well.\n * 1 c Brown Sugar\n * 1/2 c White Sugar\n * 3/4 c Butter\n4. Add eggs and vanilla to sugar + butter and mix well.\n * 1 egg\n * 1 egg yolk\n * 1 tbsp vanilla\n5. Add dry stuff into wet about 1/2 cup at a time and fold it with a gentle force.\n6. Add chocolate chips (about 1 cup but really a personal preference here).\n7. Place on cookie sheet. Make whatever size you want.\n8. Bake at 325 for 12ish minutes, until edges are browned.\n8. Remove from oven and let sit on cookie sheets for 5 minutes. Move to wire rack for 5 more minutes.\n9. Eat!!!\n\n![Cookies](cookies_med.jpg \"Cookies! (Credit:Joe Hand)\")\n\nEver since I can remember I made Chocolate Chip Cookies. In high school I discovered a recipe I really liked, memorized it, and spent the next ten years experimenting on slight variations.\n\nAfter college I really wanted to start a business making cookies. My plan was to strap a little oven on a bike trailer and go to the people. Who doesn't want a cookie that was freshed baked in front of them? Unfortunately, I got a real job.\n\n**The real secret is not what you put in the cookies, but how you make them. So be sure to add lots of love!**\n\n## Advanced Notes\n\nWant extra good cookies? Follow some or all of these advanced tips to get better cookies.\n\n#### While Making\n\n* Use a kitchen scale to weight the flour.\n* Sift the flour with salt, baking soda before adding to sugar/butter.\n* Let sugar and melted butter sit in fridge for ~30 minutes after mixing.\n\n####  Dough\n\n* The cookies are better if you wait a day or two to bake them! Let all the yummy sugar and fat work its magic.\n* Put the dough wrapped in plastic or tightly covered for 24-48hrs. I unusually do this with at least half the dough whenever I make cookies.\n* Freezing the dough works too! Let thaw in fridge overnight before baking.\n* Take it out of the fridge 30 min before you plan on baking the cookies.\n\n#### Baking\n\n* Good cookie sheets are worth it.\n* [This baking sheet](http://amzn.to/2wZmgTH) is the best.\n* [This baking sheet](http://amzn.to/2wri2Tt) is good and more forgiving.\n* Get a [silicon baking mat](http://amzn.to/2wueLAR) to bake on.\n\n#### Post Bake\n\n* They are good to eat after 5 min of cooling on a wire rack!\n* They are also still very good later! If you are storing them overnight, be sure to put them in a sealed bag or Tupperware.\n\n#### About Those Chocolate Chips\n\n* This is really a personal preference, both in quantity and quality. As long as you do not go overboard with too many chips, the cookies will turn out good.\n* I like the larger bittersweet type chocolate chips. There used to be a brand I liked the most but I forgot. It's probably in my experiment notebook somewhere.\n\nGood luck and enjoy the cookies!\n\n---\n\n## Secret Sauce\n\nOkay, you really want to make the best? Here is the super secret step by step instructions. Follow this *exactly* for the best experience. Tell everyone.\n\n#### *Prerequisite*\n\nMake the cookies above a few times. Mistakes are good! That is how we learn. Getting down your oven timing requires some practice.\n\n#### Dough Preparation\n\n1. Get all your ingredients out . Use double the recipe above.\n2. Melt butter on stove or oven. Do not burn! Low temperature.\n3. Measure flour on scale (very important to get exact weight) and add to flour sifter.\n4. Add baking soda and salt to sifter.\n5. Sift the flour into a clean, dry bowl! Cover the bowl with towel.\n6. Combine brown sugar and white sugar.\n7. Add melted butter (a few little un-melted chunks are ok)\n8. Stir stir stir! We really want to mix the fat and sugar.\n9. Set sugar + butter in fridge for 30 minutes.\n10. (30 minutes later) Remove sugar + butter from fridge.\n11. Add eggs, yolks, and vanilla into sugar + butter (room temperature is best, thats why you get them out at the start). Stir stir stir!\n12. Introduce a bit of flour (~1/2 cup) to the sugar mix and stir.\n13. Continue to add flour about ~1 cup at a time and stir with folding motion (see [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jXe-kTlTv8I) for pointers).\n14. Take a break! Stirring this much dough is hard.\n14. After most white specs are gone, start adding chocolate chips!\n15. Add about ~3/4 cup at a time until to your liking.\n16. Make dough into a big round ball (or 2 smaller ones). Fun (also fun)!\n\n#### Waiting\n\n1. Cover dough tightly with plastic wrap and place in sealed container.\n2. Put dough in fridge for exactly 36 hours. Or more than 24 hrs and less than 40.\n\n#### Baking\n\n1. Remove dough from fridge 30 minutes before baking.\n2. Turn oven to 325. Have thermometer inside to verify temperature.\n3. Use [ice cream scoop with lever](http://amzn.to/2ewt57I) to ball cookies into 2-1/4 inch scoops. Adding some flour to scooper helps.\n4. Put cookie dough on silicon baking mat on [this baking sheet](http://amzn.to/2wZmgTH).\n5. Place cookies on over rack 1/3 up from bottom.\n6. After 6 minutes, move to shelf closer to top.\n7. Remove cookies when *just* browned on visible edges. Bake cookies for approximately 12 minutes total.\n8. Remove and let sit on baking sheet for 5 minutes.\n9. Move to wire rack to cool another 5 minutes.\n10. Savor your delicious cookie and melted chocolate.\n11. Store extras in sealed container. They are still yummy and chewy a few days later! (They dry out after about 36 hours)\n\nWhen I put it that way it sounds very tedious. But for me it is a meditation. Enjoy your cookies!\n\n-Joe","name":"cookies","path":"/content/cookies","url":"/cookies","files":{"cookie_dough.jpg":{"name":"cookie_dough","path":"/content/cookies/cookie_dough.jpg","url":"/cookies/cookie_dough.jpg","source":"/content/cookies/cookie_dough.jpg","extension":".jpg","filename":"cookie_dough.jpg","type":"image"},"cookies_med.jpg":{"name":"cookies_med","path":"/content/cookies/cookies_med.jpg","url":"/cookies/cookies_med.jpg","source":"/content/cookies/cookies_med.jpg","extension":".jpg","filename":"cookies_med.jpg","type":"image"}},"pages":{}},"/notes":{"title":"Notes","view":"notes","text":"*Collections of short notes, interesting links, and fun.

[The idea](http://nownownow.com/about) was inspired by Derek Sivers.)*</span>\n\nAnother year living in Portland, Oregon! Hoping the somewhat-mild winter continues. Been loving the amount of walking I have done lately, though my bike feels a bit lonely. I had a nice end to 2017, I took a great trip to Haiti to visit a friend and enjoyed a nice (snowy!) Christmas in Portland. It's been quite the hectic start to 2018!\n\nWe've been going through [organizational changes](https://blog.datproject.org/2017/12/20/organization-changes-dat-css/) at Dat and CSS. This has been quite time consuming and left me little time for non-reactive work. I'm now co-Executive Director of CSS with [Danielle Robinson](https://twitter.com/daniellecrobins) - couldn't ask for a better person to partner with for this! I am looking forward to formalizing the structure of both Dat and CSS in the coming months as we aim to create a more sustainable business and strengthen Dat's community.\n\nOther random things:\n\n* Started using the [Bullet Journal](http://bulletjournal.com/) this year! Mine is pretty minimal, but did spend some time making spaces to track some habits and other things. I'm liking it so far, but we will see how it feels after a bit more time.\n* I've been doing the [Happy Body](https://thehappybody.com/) program for exercise. It's a nice minimal program and feel it's finally addressing some of my structural imbalances causes by my torn Achilles. Unfortunately, I can't really recommend the book because it is so hard to figure out what they are telling you to do.\n* Lots of reading lately! I am aiming for 55 books this year. Last year I set my goal for 60 but got bogged down in some super long books and read about 45. I have quite a few half finished books, so I have a head start!\n* Every year in January, the Reed Ultimate Frisbee team goes to New Years Fest, a tournament in Arizona. This year will be our 10th year! Excited! Now I just have to get in shape to play frisbee...\n\n*Last updated: 13th January 2018.*","name":"now","path":"/content/now","url":"/now","files":{},"pages":{}},"/":{"title":"jhand.space","view":"home","links":{"notes":{"title":"Notes","url":"/notes"},"books":{"title":"Books I am Reading","url":"/books"},"cookies":{"title":"Making the Best Chocolate Chip Cookies","url":"/cookies"},"css":{"title":"Code for Science & Society","url":"https://codeforscience.org"},"dat":{"title":"Dat Project","url":"https://datproject.org"}},"text":"Hello!
