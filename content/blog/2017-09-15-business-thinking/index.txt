In the last few months I've been thinking and reading a lot about starting and funding thoughtful technology businesses. You can see my [book list](/book-shelf) for books on traditional business and marketing resources. But at Dat Project, we aren't seeking to just start a regular business. To learn more I've been looking at awesome examples of thoughtful, modern, tech-driven businesses.

There have been some resources I keep going back to. As we share more about our nonprofit, Code for Science & Society, you'll see some themes emerging. A lot of that is driven by the writing and ideas from these amazing people. I'll keep this list updated and we continue to learn more.

## Funding Open Source - Nadia Eghbal

When starting a new business the first thing you need to decide is how to fund it. *In this case, I separate business from project. A project is something you can start with your extra time. A business is exists to be about more than you. We've started to make that shift with Dat.*

But funding can be hard and confusing!
